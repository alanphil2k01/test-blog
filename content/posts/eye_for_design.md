As a graphic designer and as a person, Harinarayanan explained that he needed **stimulus** and he used it to fuel his creativity. By drawing lines of similarity between design and cooking, where we combine things, measure proportions and blend them together in order to create something new, he explained how the abundance of stimulus around us can be used positively and in favour of design.

There is power in design, from working as a designer in corporate and marketing fields, Harinarayanan talked about how design is about manipulating people into making certain choices and it leaves you with an inflated ego.

Most designers have humble beginnings and the speaker didn't have it any differently. He contrasted between his early works that he started off by using Microsoft Powerpoint ( no shame in that ) and his best works to point out the progress he made. From using oversaturated colours to finding the right colour palette, choosing the right fonts along with giving more care for the layout to highlight and emphasis, there is a lot to be learnt and over time you will develop your own set of unique practices.

To make the best use of your skills and creativity, you need the right tools. There is a lot of tools out there but these are the most used and essential :
1. Canva - As much as you love making things from scratch, there are times when you just need to get the work done efficiently and at the same time deliver high quality designs without much effort. Using Canva and the wide range of features it has like templates, basic editing and illustrations, you can make sure you are consistently creating and publishing your best work.
2. Photoshop - One of the best design tools out there. The learning curve might be slow and hard to progress through in terms of the UI and the abundance of tools that are available, but once mastered, you wonâ€™t need anything else.
3. Figma - It is useful for working with teams and making integrated designs like carousels for instagram, UI/UX, colour themed posters, etc. The UI is more simple and easier to understand, but not any less powerful.
4. Blender - It is the best tool for 3d digital art and rendering. With the rise in value and popularity of NFTs, Blender has become one of the leading 3D design tools.
